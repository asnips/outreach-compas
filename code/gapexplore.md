As you can observe, there is a large discrepancy. Does this change when we condition on other variables?

1. Look at how priors are distributed. Follow what you did above for score by race or use `%load code/priors` for help
1. Look at how scores are distributed for those with more than two priors (%load code/2priorscores)
1. What about with less than two priors (you can copy or import again the above and modify it)
1. Look at first time (use `priors_count`) felons (`c_charge_degree` of `F`) under 25. How is this different?


Then `mdshow('code/actual.md')`
