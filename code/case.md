## A COMPAS Case study

Next, let's look at what COMPAS is before we look at the data.

The COMPAS score comes from the results of a [137 item survey](compas-core-sample.pdf).  It is distributed with a long [Practitioner's guide](compas_guide.pdf) that describes how it was developed and validated including which criminal theories it relies on. The claim is that COMPAS predicts two-year recidivism.  It has an accuracy around 67%.

### Discussion Questions

Breifly skim those and discuss things you find with your group. Make notes in the shared document about the following questions:

1. If the survey is administered through a social worker vs the defendent answering independently how might that impact responses?
1. How does knowing that the COMPAS score comes from that survey impact your view of it?  What problems might you predict?
1. Who might this survey privelege?
