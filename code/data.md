## Propublica COMPAS Data

The dataset consists of COMPAS scores assigned to defendants over two years 2013-2014 in Broward County, Florida. These scores are determined by a proprietary algorithm designed to evaluate a persons recidivism risk - the likelihood that they will reoffend. Risk scoring algorithms are widely used by judges to inform their scentencing and bail decisions in the criminal justice system in the United States. The original ProPublica analysis identified a number of fairness concerns around the use of COMPAS scores, including that ''black defendants were nearly twice as likely to be misclassified as higher risk compared to their white counterparts.''
