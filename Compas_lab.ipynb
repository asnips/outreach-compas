    "Propublica started the COMPAS Debate with the article [Machine Bias](#References).  With their article, they also released details of their methodology and their [data and code](https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis).  This presents a real data set that can be used for research on how data is used in a criminal justice settingn without researchers having to perform their own requests for information, so it has been used and reused a lot of times. \n",
